- Installation 
* note if you already have a version of the plugin installed, please remove it first in chrome://chrome/extensions/
by clicking on the little trash can icon by the respective Phormatter plugin. Also be sure that Chrome is as
up to date as possible in terms of versioning.

1. click or visit http://headstash.co/phormatter/phormatter.crx to download extension
2. open the following url in chrome chrome://chrome/extensions/
3. drag and drop the downloaded extension in step 1 into the page offered by step 2.

Please don't pass around the above to other people, I want to limit the Beta as well as not letting
it get into the hand of PT trolls since one of the goals is to make it "easier" to PT, I don't
want to increase the productivity of people who just tarnish the community.

currently beta functionality: 

1. side by side threads and thread render 
2. my threads layout similar to above 
3. highlight "my threads" when they appear on main board. 
* main board is just page 1 of PT for now. 
4. can post a reply to a thread / can not create new threads yet 
5. displays photos and you tubes "inline" (meaning right in the page, so be careful for NSFW)
6. My favorite, hit the space bar to update threads.
